# Elevate_Labs_Internship_task1

Summary: 
         In this exercise, we performed a comprehensive network analysis and vulnerability assessment of a target system. Our findings revealed several open and filtered ports, highlighting potential security risks associated with each service. Through our analysis, we provided recommendations to mitigate these risks and improve overall system security. This exercise demonstrates the importance of regularly monitoring and assessing network infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Ultimately, our goal is to help organizations maintain robust security postures and protect against evolving threats.
Overall, this task involved the following key activities:
1.	Network scanning and enumeration
2.	Service identification and classification
3.	Risk assessment and prioritization
4.	Vulnerability mitigation and remediation strategies
5.	Reporting and documentation
This process highlights the critical role of proactive network analysis and vulnerability management in maintaining a secure and resilient IT infrastructure. By staying vigilant and continuously improving security practices, organizations can better defend against emerging threats and reduce the likelihood of compromise.
